This is a force-directed bipartite network of Dada journals and authors taken from the third chapter of Jörgen Schäfer's bibliography _Exquisite Dada_. Orange nodes represent authors. Blue nodes represent journals.

I created this network by using the Python module NetworkX and by outputting the data into a JSON file that is compatibility with D3.

# How to Explore
