This is a force-directed publication network of Dada journals and authors taken from the third chapter of Jörgen Schäfer's bibliography _Exquisite Dada_. Orange nodes represent authors. Blue nodes represent journals. Edge weights represent number of publications.

I created this graph using the Python module NetworkX. This visualization was forked from John Ladd and Mike Bostock.
